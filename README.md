 - Remainders can be triggered at some specific time or be relative to the task due time
 - Tasks may be repeated in many flexible ways (e.g. like repeated events in Google Calendar)
 - Task repetition may be limited by some end date or after a certain number of occurences
 - Tasks may have a description
 - Tasks may be completed
 - Tasks may be hidden until some date
 - Chrome and Android apps that will be sycnronized
 - On Android remainders will be triggered as system notifications with optional sound and vibration
 - On Chrome remainders will be triggered as desktop notifications

Other features that may appear in later releases:
 - Task priorities
 - Multiple task lists

Note that this is not a business solution and not designed for managing projects and/or distributing
tasks to the team members (there are plenty such apps on the market). It is designed as a personal
organizer app.
